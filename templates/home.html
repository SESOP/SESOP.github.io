			<h1>Power Supply vs Demand</h1>
			<p>The South African Electricity Sector has been receiving significant attention over the past several years due to continued blackouts. Local demand for electricity has grown rapidly over the past few years in South Africa and continues to do so. This demand has been spurred on by economic and population growth, which have out grown the growth rate of electricity supply. The State-owned electricity generator and supplier, Eskom, currently generates around 95% of the countryâ€™s electricity, just over 41,000 MW. However, projections suggest that by 2025 this needs to reach 80,000 MW. With energy supply constantly under pressure and blackouts expected to continue into 2015, there is an urgent need for change in the energy sector. </p>

			<p>The Integrated Resources Plan (IPR) was finalised in March 2011, with the intention of creating an additional 52,248MW of new power producing capacity. The introduction of Independent Power Producers (IPP) has been included to meet long term demand for electricity in South Africa. This has created opportunities for private investors to get involved in the alternative energy space.</p>
